# Deals Slack App


## How to make changes: 

To make changes to the code, clone this repo. Be sure to include environment variables such for HubSpot. You can create a new Slack app to test your changes locally. 

> **Warning: Editing the production app's manifest to a local endpoint can disrupt the end user experience.**

Once changes are deployed, you must also deploy to Heroku with `git push heroku main`. You'll need to be logged into Heroku too.
